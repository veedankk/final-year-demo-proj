# SDG 13 — Climate Action (Responsive Multimedia Webpage)

This small project demonstrates a responsive multimedia webpage built for an assignment showcasing advanced CSS, responsive design, and multimedia embedding.

Files:
- `index.html` — page structure and embedded media
- `styles.css` — external stylesheet using Grid/Flexbox, variables, media queries, pseudo-classes
- `script.js` — small interaction for mobile nav

How to open:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local server).

Notes:
- Images and media use external URLs for convenience.
- Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile via CSS media queries.
